# terroriser
Uses the Results and Graphics Engine (RAGE) and performs data anaylsis to intelligently find regressions in builds.

Usage:

    For a frontend GUI for interacting with terroriser call:
        `python3 tinker.py`

    For machine learning analysis on a branch use:
        `python3 regression.py [branch name]`

    For machine learning analysis comparing two branches use:
        `python3 regression.py [branch name] --branch2 [branch name]`

Concerns:
    Front-end GUI is complete but regression script still needs work.

Version: 0.9.7
